**What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?**
The 6 Phases of Web Design are:
1. Information Gathering: understand the objectives and requirements for the site
2. Planning: a site map is created to get an overview of the topics to be included in the website
3. Design: a prototype (static or dynamic) of the website is created to present the look and feel of the website
4. Development: a functional website is created
5. Testing and Delivery: test are perfomed on the website and if everything is finalized the site is delivered/published
6. Maintenance: updating contain and ensure the site stay relevant and compatible with technology updates

**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**
The primary purpose of my site is to showcase my work, thought process and capabilities.  I will feature a portfolio of my work, information about myself and contact details.

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**
As I intend to send my website to potential employers, I believe they would like to see the standard and capabilities of my work, how I solve problems and my visual aesthetics (as I would like to get into front-end development).

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**
The primary action I would like users to do is get back in touch with me.This could be just to chat about something they find interesting or potential opportunities.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**
Ultimately, the most important thing they should know is how to design for a postive "user" experience. In the past, web sites have been designed and developed with a bias on what the client wants as opposed to what the user needs.  This shift towards user-centered design makes important for someone to know how they can go about designer for the user in mind.  There are many methodologies and tools for this including A/B Testing, user surveys, user personas, wireframing/prototyping.

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**
User Experience Design is the field related to creating positive experience when users interact with a system (website, application, software, electronics).

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**
The most tedious part of this challenge was to go through the list of websites about UX from the posted article.  Since we are talking about UX design there was a lot of scrolling that was required.  For me personally, there should be a way to get a feel for all the websites about UX in one screen without that much scrolling.
