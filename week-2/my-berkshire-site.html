<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It was a great experience to build an actual site.  Just with HTML alone we were able to replicate the home page of a billion dollar company (although the site is a bit oversimplistic).

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  Thus far the experience of researching and using semantic HTML 5 has been good.  However, it looks like there is still a lot of things about HTML5 that I dont know.  The good thing is that I am picking up a lot of new things from pairing.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  We minimzed any use of formatting in our initial code. Furthermore, we applied the same structured for a basic HTML with this exercise.  We indented our code to make sure it is easy to read and reference for later.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  The good thing about HTML is that the tags are quite intuitive to what they are designed to do.  This makes it easy to pick up.  For example, <body> refers to the body of the page, <ol> refers to the ordered list etc.

  The bad thing about HTML is some tags are inconsistent.  For example the <img> tag does not have a closing tag. Additionally, HTML allows for minimal styling which is redundant with CSS.  I can foresee having issues with formatting if I forgot that I used styling in HTML and applying the same sytling in CSS.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  Before writing the code, I would start by defining the structure of the code with doctype, html, header, body, and footer tags.  This initial structure provides a good fram for me to start.  Thus far all tags should have a closing tag except for image. I don't really have tricks but I try to remember the syntax as best as I can.
