**How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?**

The Chrome DevTool is great to be able to isolate elements and and apply changes and see those changes on the screen.  This is a lot more efficient than making changes on sublime and opening the files in a browser to see the changes take place. Furthermore, I feel like it is harder to isolate and pinpoint elements in Sublime as opposed to the Chrome Dev Tool.

**How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?**

I would select the element that needs to be resized and change the height and width property of that element to the size that I need.

**What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?**
Absolute: will position the element relative to the nearest positioned parent.
Fixed: will position the element in relations to the browser. This could be used for elements that maintain their position on the screen ie header navigation.
Static: will position the element in the default value as they appear in the document. This is the default position of elements.
Relative: will position the element relative to the normal default position when additional position properties like left and right is applied.

The one that made the most sense to me was fixed position. Because it was easier to implement and see the changes. The relative position was tricky to grasp but I think with more experimentation I should get a hang on it.

**What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?**

**What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)**

This exercise was fun as it was great to see the inner workings of css and how they all work together to create a visual web page. There were moments that was frustrating when making one change negatively impacted another aspect of the page. In any case we tried to learn from these experiences. I am sure there will be more of these occurences.
