**What does puts do?**
puts is a ruby command that stands for put string. puts prints the output of the code to a new line, however, it does not return any value.

**What is an integer? What is a float?**
An integer is a number without decimal points. A float is a number with decimal points.

**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**
Integer division will not return any remainders. For example the integer 5 divided by the integer 2 (5/2) will return 2.  The remainder 0.5 will not be displayed and ruby willl round down the value. Float division, on the other hand will return the remainder.  A good way to explain float division is if you are out with a 5 friends and in total you only have 7 dollars in cash. If you all want to take the bus home and the bus ticket is $2. Only 3 of you will be able to get home by bus.  The remainder 1 dollar will not suffice to get anyone tickets.

**Write a program that calculates and outputs the:**

**Hours in a year**
'''
puts 24 * 365
'''

**Minutes in a decade**
'''
puts 60 * 1 * 24 * 365 * 10
'''

**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**
Ruby handles basic arithemetic with build in methods that are part of the ruby language. These methods
are called with the same symbols we see in grade school.

**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**
Strings are a series of characters including letters, punctuations, digits, symbols and spaces. They
are denoted by having the characters between two quotation marks.

**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**
Local variables are a way to store a data value to the local environment of the program. On the other
hand a global variable can be assigned and used in the entire program; whereas the local variable
can only be used where it was defined.

**How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**
This challenge started off a little bit rocky, but once I understood the objective of the rspec then it became easier to complete.
