**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**
Integer division will not return any remainders. For example the integer 5 divided by the integer 2 (5/2) will return 2.  The remainder 0.5 will not be displayed and ruby willl round down the value. Float division, on the other hand will return the remainder.  A good way to explain float division is if you are out with a 5 friends and in total you only have 7 dollars in cash. If you all want to take the bus home and the bus ticket is $2. Only 3 of you will be able to get home by bus.  The remainder 1 dollar will not suffice to get anyone tickets.
