##Think About Time

**Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?**

The time management technique that I learned about and struct my interest was the Pomodoro Technique. The idea is that one would take a 5 minute break after every 25 minutes of working.  The structured approach ensured that one is focused during the 25 minutes but also has a 5 minute break to loosen up.  I learned many new productivity tips from the provided resources. The idea of starting small really spoke to me.  I could see how being challenged with an extremely large and complicated project could lead to a paralysis of inaction. At least starting small means that I could be working towards something and keep up the productivity. Additionally, I found the benefits of meditation including an enhance in productivity to be quite motivating. I have practiced meditation in the past but this gives me a great reason to meditate everyday.

**What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?**

Time Boxing is a project methodology whereby a strict time frame is established and the individual/team works towards a goal within that time frame.  The work completed thus far would be evaluated after the time has ended. In DBC, I could foresee being assigned difficult projects.  I could use Time Boxing to break down the problem in to multiple components and give myself a set amount of time to complete each task.  Although the work might not be fully polished I should have a Minimum Viable Product to show for.

**How do you manage your time currently?**

Currently, I do not have a systematic way of managing my time.  While working, I find myself taking breaks and being side tracked.  For example, a small break to change the music might lead research the band's history or look at the concert calendar.  My time management is usually worst when I am working from home where I have many distractions.

**Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?**

My current time management strategy needs a lot of improvement.  The lack of structure in the way I manage time makes it easy for me to get into a cycle of taking long breaks.  The longer the breaks, the more difficult is it for me to get back to working.

**Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?**

The Pomodoro Technique stands out as a method that could help me manage my time more effectively.  I like that I have to be more disciplined with my time and work towards the 25 minute mark.  Furthermore, the 5 minute break in regular intervals allows me to relax so that I can be ready for the next productivity burst.

After reading about the Pomodoro Technique I tried to implement it directly with this assignment.  I found it to be quite effective; however, it got harder after a few cycles.  I will try to stick with the routine and see how it improves my productivity.

**What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?**

I do not want to rush through the assignments because I want to absorb as much as I can from this program.  In any case I would like to do this in an efficient manner. My plan is to work on one or two assignments in the module in each day of the week.  By spreading out the work load, I should be able to complete my assignments but also have time to absorb all the content throughout the week.

## The Command Line

**What is a shell? What is "bash?"**

In the context of programming, a shell is a language based user interface that allows people to interact with the computer's operating system.  Bash is one of many shell interfaces available.  Bash is a popular command line interface because it is the default shell in OSX and Linux.

**What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?**

The most challenging aspect of this exercise was remembering all of the commands.  However, the commands that took be the hardest for me to grasp was pushd and popd.  I had to watch a youtube explanation of these two commands to actually understand what it was doing.

**Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?**

I was able to use all of the commands while going through the exercise.  However, some of the commands that took longer to figure out was pushd, popd < , >  and |.

**In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?**

I think this would really depend on what the user intends to do and the sophistication of the user. However, for me personally, I think the most important commands to know from The Command Line Crash Course are how to navigate from the directories (cd, cd ..), view directories and its components (pwd, ls) and manipulating files and directories (mkdir, rmdif, mv, rm).  Another important command to know and would be useful is man.  The language in man is still cryptic to me but I think after using it for awhile and having some context it should be easier to digest.

**Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.**
- pwd: print working directory; it displays what directory level the user is currently on
- ls: list; it displays the files and directories in the current directory
- mv: move; is used to move files
- cd: change directory; allows users to move to a new directory
- ../: allows to user to move to the previous directory when used with cd ie cd ..
- touch: allows the user to create a file
- mkdir: make directory; allows the user to make a new directory
- less: displays the content within a file and allows the user to navigate it page by page
- rmdir: remove directory; allows the user to remove the directory that is designated
- rm: remove; allows users to remove files
- help: for OSX I use man to get to the manual of commands or arguments

## Forking and Cloning


**If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?**

Create a New Repo in GitHub
A. Go to the home page of GitHub and make sure you are signed in
B. Click on the plus sign at the top right of the screen (near your profile picture)
C. A drop down menu should appear, with the option to create a new repository
D. Name and configure the repository and click "Create Repository"

Fork a Repo in GitHub
A. Make sure you are signed in to Github
B. Go to the repository you would like to fork
C. Click on the fork button of the repository you would like to fork (you may have to select which github account you want the repo to be forked to assuming you have multiple github accounts.)

Clone a Repo in GitHub via the CLI
A. Go to the repo you want to fork on github, copy the the HTTPS URL associated to that URL
B. In your terminal, navigate to the folder you would like to clone the repo to via the cd command
C. Type "git clone " followed by the HTTPS URL you copied from the GitHub page and hit RETURN
D. Type ls to check whether the repo has been cloned to your selected directory.

You would want to fork a repo as opposed to creating a new one, if you wanted to work on an existing code base that is already available elsewhere.  You might get your hands on open source code that has the licensing for you to make changes so instead of reinventing the wheel you can fork the code and adapt it to your needs.

**What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?**

The biggest struggle for me is remember the different git commands and what they do. I think it makes sense to watch someone do it.  However, it is a different situation to do it myself.  I think have a solid mental map of what is happening at each command will be important to learn as well as the commands itself.  After getting an overview of Git and GitHub, through these exercises I learned how to create repos, fork repos, and clone repos.
