**Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.**

**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**
Create a New Repo in GitHub
A. Go to the home page of GitHub and make sure you are signed in
B. Click on the plus sign at the top right of the screen (near your profile picture)
C. A drop down menu should appear, with the option to create a new repository
D. Name and configure the repository and click "Create Repository"

Clone a Repo in GitHub via the CLI
A. Go to the repo you want to fork on github, copy the the HTTPS URL associated to that URL
B. In your terminal, navigate to the folder you would like to clone the repo to via the cd command
C. Type "git clone " followed by the HTTPS URL you copied from the GitHub page and hit RETURN
D. Type ls to check whether the repo has been cloned to your selected directory.

**Describe what open source means.**
Open source means that people have access to the source code and are able to update and make changes to the source code. Converserly if the code is proprietary, user will only have the option to use the software but not be able to make any changes to the code itself.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**
I think this would depend on what side of the market I was on. As a consumer, I would love for everything to be free including software and have a community where people can make updates to the software for the betterment of society.  On the flip side, people would like to be compensated for the effort they put in and therefore they do not make their software open source. At the end of the day, I would say that people should have options of what they want to do with their creative efforts.

**Assess the importance of using licenses.**
Licensing is important as it allows owners of the software to grant the appropriate permission on how other people can use, update and profit from your original work.

**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**
The repetition with git was extremely helpful although I still had to look up references. I'll still have to go over it a few more time for it to sink in. I am pretty confident about creating a repository and initiative a pull request.  Its the git commands that I still need to work on.

**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**
For the most part I relied on the resources provided.
